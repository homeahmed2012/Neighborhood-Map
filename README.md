# Neighborhood Map

This project is my fifth project in `full stack web developer nanodegree`.

It uses google maps api to show some historical places in my neighborhood.

In the left side there is a list of the places that appears in the map.

You can search the places by entering the name of the place that you want.

## Usage

* clone the repository to your local machine.
* open `index.html` in you web browser.

## Some Features

* use wikipedia api to show some information about the places.
* responsive design: render well in all screen sizes.
